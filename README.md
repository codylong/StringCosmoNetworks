# StringCosmoNetworks
Construct and study the network of toric bases for 4d F-theory. The code provided is sufficient to generate the network, but
requires a significant computations (~24 hours on Northeastern's discovery cluster in parallel). This network is input data for
the cosmological model studied in [Vacuum Selection from Cosmology on Networks of String Geometries](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.101602).
